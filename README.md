# Electricity Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project explores how advanced machine learning algorithms can accurately forecast electricity usage patterns. By analyzing historical consumption data, the goal is to build models that can anticipate future demand—helping utilities plan better, reduce waste, and move toward smarter energy management.

## Project Summary

With rising global energy demands, it's vital to predict electricity usage in real-time. This project applies multiple machine learning models and optimizes them using hyperparameter tuning techniques to forecast electricity consumption more effectively. It uses models like XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP, Ridge Regression, and Linear Regression, all trained and compared on real consumption data.

## Objectives

1. Predict future electricity consumption based on historical usage data.
2. Compare the effectiveness of different regression models.
3. Optimize each model through hyperparameter tuning.
4. Identify which model performs best for real-world deployment.
